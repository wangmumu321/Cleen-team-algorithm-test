A company has an machine for cutting sheet metal. Given a rectangular sheet of metal that is H feet high and W feet wide, this machine can cut through the entire sheet either horizontally or vertically. Each day, the company downloads a list of orders for rectangular pieces of sheet metal. This list consists of n entries, where for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, hi × wi denotes the height and width of the piece, and pi denotes the profit for selling a piece of this size. (The metal has a directional surface finish, so you cannot use a 5 × 3 piece to fill an order for a 3 × 5 piece.) Orders may be filled multiple times, so if a piece of a certain size is worth $5, the company would receive $15 for generating three copies of this piece. Any leftover pieces that are not on the order list are wasted and cost $1 each, irrespective of their size. The company wants you to write a problem that determines the sequence of cuts to produce the maximum total profit.
